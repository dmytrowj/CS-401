# CS-401
Cs 401 class 

This is the readme for my gitHub.

A readme is supposed to help someone who would like to test out your code or application. Within the Readme there would be specific areas for each part of an application. There should also be folders that organize the github.

For my github I will have 3 documents:
Task 1 -- The Paper
Task 2 -- The Platform
Task 3 -- The Future/The Past
Project -- Raspberry Torrent

I Will also provide the website created for my Task 2.

For task 2 I did the Platform on Mobile Roadie. I will not be able to upload the app I create because I do not have the credentials to apply to make my app live. Because of this technicality I am going to provide pictures within my report to show how the app Platform works.

A typical github for a real application would have the following folders:
Current Build
x32 version
x64 version
Notes

Lastly, Here is the link to my Notebook:
